                      Sensing (CS) is targeted at reconstructing a signal from a small set of measurements, if the signal is sparse
                    in some domains. In this respect, a low coherent measurement matrix plays an important role. In this letter, an efficient approximation
                    of ‚Ñì‚àû norm based on the soft maximum was introduced to design a low coherent measurement matrix with a controllable
                    spectral norm. The proposed approximation, called Logarithm of Sum of Exponential Absolute values (LSEAp), is convex (similar
                    to ‚Ñì‚àû norm) and almost smooth. Acordingly, we designed a low coherent measurement matrix with a small spectral norm via minimization
                    of the ‚Ñì‚àû norm of the Gram matrix. The resulting problem was not convex but our simulations show that the LSEAp leads to
                    an improved design of the measurement matrix, as compared to current methods.</p>

                           the perturbations intensity. The proposed method implements sparsity and imperceptibility criteria using the Smoothed ‚Ñì0 
                           function and an approximation of ‚Ñì‚àû norm, respectively. In this project, the proposed sparse adversarial attacks were developed

                        This project was my master thesis that evaluates the robustness of deep networks against the designed adversarial attack via
                        imperceptible sparse perturbation. Thereby, the important challenges are controlling the sparsity of the perturbations and the amount of
                         perturbation of the each element. For these, I used ‚Ñì‚àû and ‚Ñì0 norms. The other methods for designing adversarial attacks, often seek to
                          minimize the number of the perturbed elements of the adversarial image by replacing ‚Ñì0 norm with $l_1$ norm, $l_2$norm
                        or search methods that are focuce on all elements of RGB. While in reality, the number of perturbed pixels is important. The other methods
                         for designing the imperceptible adversarial attacks often use clipping (projecting on the ‚Ñì‚àû normball) which requires knowing
                        the threshold of the desirable maximum value of perturbations. The proposed method
                        of this project implement sparsity and imperceptibility criteria by SL0 and LSEAp functions,
                        respectively. These functions grant much better approximations for these criteria than other
                        functions that both are composed of exponential functions. In this project, proposed adversarial
                        attacks are developed in a way that the sparse element types are convertable into sparse
                        pixel or grouped types. The results show that the adversarial attacks proposed in this project
                        have the perfect attack accuracy for networks witch are used in this project (even the one witch
                        is resistant to adversarial attacks) and render better controlling over the sparsity and the ‚Ñì‚àû norm
                        criteria, compared to the other methods. They achieved imperceptibility because the
                        functions used in this project were able to approximate the sparsity and the ‚Ñì‚àû norm
                        considerably, and the LSEAp function, unlike other methods, tries to reduce the ‚Ñì‚àû norm
                        according to the input pattern. Both these functions are implemented easily by hardware.

                    In this project, a modular method and an iterative method were used to compensate for distortion of 
                    common interpolators. according to the modular method, the interpolation function is multiplied by 1 +2 [cos(2ùëáùúãùë°)+cos(4ùëáùúãùë°)+‚ãØ +cos(2ùëÅùúã)] and then
                     got low-pass filter. This method is like that the frequency domain of the interpolated signal is shifted by T (1/T Sampling rate
                      of the original signal). It helps to amplify the original signal and attenuate interpolating effect on the frequency domain.
                      The interpolation of a discrete signal is modeled as the output of a linear time-invariant system when the inputs are the discrete samples.
                      Thereby, An iterative method can be used to recover the original signal from the interpolated discrete signal and the filtering.
                      The iterative method was very useful for recovering that it could improve the SNR of the interpolation by 35 dB on average while the modular method 
                      increase the SNR about 15dB. Indeed For exact recovery, the number of modules used in the modular method realy should be infinite.
                       But in fixed-point computations we never obtain an exact recovery. Hence, the iterative method can approximately
                       converge to the original signal after several iterations with relatively low computations.

                     which was about detecting people with masks.
                     For this, I used a practicable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and I prepared my own dataset to identify the mask in the frames of a video. 
                     Issues were to track the position of a person with a mask in the frames of videos and crop its head that these were addresed with
                      detection of eyes in the frames. </p>
